# IndusInd-Bank

This application was built to learn about front-end and backend features in Python.
This was my first ever coding related experience and my teacher gave me a view about how Python is revolving in today's world. Using MySQL 5.5 and Python 3.5 or 3.6 this was built and mainly it was to use backend on the same screen as input.

The bank workers feeling at ease when uploading and retrieving data was my main objective and resulting in a basic working project. Few features were yet to be added.
